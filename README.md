# Diamond Pricing Analysis
Phase 3 Project for Flatiron school's Data Science Live curriculum
---

The goal of this project was to analyze and make predictions on a dataset of choice, using supervised learning models.

The dataset I used was found on this Kaggle page: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/miguelcorraljr/brilliant-diamonds

There are two main notebooks in this project:
- The Exploratory Data Analysis Notebook
- The Predictive Modeling Notebook

In the EDA notebook, I performed an exploratory data analysis of the diamonds dataset in order to get a feel for how the data is structured and what features could potentially be used in the machine learning process. In the predictive modeling notebook, I utilized the insights and results from the EDA notebook to create and train a model that predicts categorical price labels based on the attributes of a diamond. The final model was a Random Forest Classifier that performed with an average accuracy score of about 83%.

I initially tried to predict the price in the context of a regression problem, but the task proved to be very difficult in the time allotted so I decided to pursue a classification-oriented task instead.
